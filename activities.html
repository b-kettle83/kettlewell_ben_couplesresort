                    <p>Algonquin Park, the first provincial park in Ontario, protected from the noise and rush of civilization, this 
                        world-renowned park in Ontario is a sanctuary for the rugged beauty of the maple, pine, moose, and wolves.</p>
                    <p>Just steps away from The Couples Resort, Algonquin's 7,630 square kilometres of forests, lakes, and rivers have 
                        assumed an almost incalculable importance as a living link with a vanishing past with a diverse and unblemished 
                        eco-system that can be found nowhere else on earth </p>

                    <p>Couples resort is located on the shores of Galeairy Lake, with direct access to Algonquin Park. Galeairy Lake is 11 
                        kilometres (7 miles) long, land locked and extends mostly inside the boundaries of Algonquin Park . Explore the 
                        many secluded coves by canoe or kayak and search for loons, beaver, otter and moose. Pull up on shore, have a 
                        picnic and go for a swim. It is very clean and safe, with water temperatures hitting 25C (78F) by the end of July. 
                        Typically the lake temperature is above 18C (70F) from the third week of June to the first week of September.</p>
