                <h2 class="hidden">About Our Policies</h2>
                <p>Please observe a NO EXTRA TIPPING policy, as we wish that you would rather take another appointment, do another 
                    activity, have another wine or stay another nightâ€¦..any of these will help all, far more than a single extra tip</p>
                <p>100 Percent of the full treatment price will be charged to your account for cancellations and no-shows made less than 
                    twelve (12) hours prior to the appointment time</p>
                <p>It is very rare that one of our Spa Professionals gets sick or has a family emergency and we understand it is 
                    extremely disappointing to not have the treatment you requested. Staff will make every effort in finding an 
                    alternative time in the day or during your stay with another therapist, sometimes involving a slightly different 
                    Treatment. We appreciate our guests for being so patient during these unforeseen circumstances. Currently if there is 
                    a cancellation and you cannot be accommodated, there will be no Spa charge to your room. A Free Voucher for a 1 hour 
                    (Not RMT) Spa Treatment will now be provided for your next getaway at the Couples Resort. The Policy change allows us 
                    not only to make sure there is no out of pocket expense (the cost of the treatment) but that we will also compensate 
                    you beyond what the Couples Resort could not provide you </p>
                <p>Thank You & Enjoy in Our Pleasure,<br>John Sorensen, President</p>
